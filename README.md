# ytdl-webserver
A simple webserver with ytdl-core features implemented. I may or may not add more stuff, do what you want!        
Maybe I'll play around with stuff like google drive, who knows?


# Quick start guide:
This webserver is hosted on port `3000`, so if you are hosting this on your local network, your link could look like these:
```
192.168.x.x/mp4?=
http://localhost:3000/mp4?id="VIDEO ID HERE"

Video IDs look like this:
IUPYpZBfsMU (This video is made, owned and posted by jeff geerling and deserves credit for it, I'm just using it as an example, any request to take it down is accepted.)
```
# install and run

```
git clone https://github.com/pendragons-code/ytdl-webserver/

```
